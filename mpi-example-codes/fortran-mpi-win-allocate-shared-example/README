 Compilation of the fortran source code of this kind of "hello world" example
 for investigating how to work with MPI_WIN_ALLOCATE_SHARED:

  Check which fortran compiler you are using. The default Makefile include file is:
   Makefile.gfortran
  However others can be included instead:
   Makefile.gfortran-mp-6-mac
   Makefile.gfortran-lisa
   Makefile.ifort-lisa
   Makefile.ifort-staff.science
   Makefile.mpif90

  Compilation of this source goes by

   cd src/
   make all
   cd ../

  Run this program by using a config file. The defaultrun example is:
   mpiexec -n 2 ./src/fortran_mpi_win_allocate_shared_example_program config-files/config-mpi-example
  Or run it with the long-local-run.csh script (in its own run directory):
   ./long-local-run.csh fortran_mpi_win_allocate_shared_example_program config-files/config-mpi-example test
