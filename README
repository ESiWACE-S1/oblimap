 Compilation of the SEQUENTIAL OBLIMAP fortran source code:

  Check which fortran compiler you are using. The default Makefile include file is:
   Makefile.gfortran
  However others can be included instead:
   Makefile.gfortran-mp-6-mac
   Makefile.gfortran-lisa
   Makefile.ifort-lisa
   Makefile.ifort-stampede
   Makefile.ftn-cca-ecmwf

  In these Makefile.* one should check the NETCDF path, in our default this is:
   NETCDF_PATH = /usr
  After these checks / adjustments one can compile the OBLIMAP source by

   cd src/
   make all
   cd ../

  Run oblimap by using a config file. The default gcm to im run example is:
   ./src/oblimap_gcm_to_im_program config-files/oblimap/racmo2.3-to-im-greenland/config-oblimap-racmo2.3-to-im-greenland-20x20km
  and the default example in the reverse direction is:
   ./src/oblimap_im_to_gcm_program config-files/oblimap/im-to-racmo2.3-greenland/config-oblimap-im-to-racmo2.3-greenland-20x20km
  Or with the tiny script (which includes cpu profiling):
   ./oblimap-to-and-fro-mapping.csh

  The OBLIMAP User Guide provides a more extended description:

 Compilation of the PARALLEL OBLIMAP fortran source code:

  Check which fortran compiler you are using. The default Makefile include file is:
   Makefile.gfortran
  However others can be included instead (check also their NETCDF path):
   Makefile-par.gfortran-mac
   Makefile-par.ifort-lisa
   Makefile-par.ifort-stampede

  One can compile the OBLIMAP-par source by

   cd src/
   make -f Makefile-par all
   cd ../

  Run oblimap-par by using a config file. The default gcm to im run example is:
   ./src/oblimap_par_gcm_to_im_program config-files/oblimap/racmo2.3-to-im-greenland/config-oblimap-racmo2.3-to-im-greenland-20x20km
  and the default example in the reverse direction is:
   ./src/oblimap_par_im_to_gcm_program config-files/oblimap/im-to-racmo2.3-greenland/config-oblimap-im-to-racmo2.3-greenland-20x20km
  Or with the tiny script (which includes cpu profiling):
   ./oblimap-par-to-and-fro-mapping.csh 2
